## Best Practices for Future Development

1. **Client vs Server Components**
   - Interactive UI code should go in client components with the `'use client'` directive
   - Metadata should go in server components (no `'use client'` directive)
   - Server components should import and use client components
   - Never include metadata objects in client components

2. **SEO Metadata Standards**
   - Every page should have a unique title (preferably 50-60 characters)
   - Every page should have a unique description (120+ characters)
   - Keywords should be relevant and include 5+ terms
   - OpenGraph images should be provided for all pages
   - Include proper canonical and hreflang tags for all pages

3. **Component Structure**
   - For product pages: `/[product]/client.tsx` for UI and `/[product]/page.tsx` for metadata
   - For category pages: `/[category]/client.tsx` for UI and `/[category]/page.tsx` for metadata
   - For dynamic pages: Use `generateMetadata` function in `page.tsx`

4. **Bilingual Content Handling**
   - Ensure every English page has a properly optimized Arabic counterpart
   - Use the metadata helper for consistent canonical and hreflang implementation
   - Set x-default hreflang to English version

## Remaining Issues

The following issues still need to be addressed:

1. **Long Titles (88 Pages)**
   - Consider shortening titles that exceed 60 characters
   - Focus on most important keywords and remove redundant information

2. **Missing OpenGraph Images (9 Pages)**
   - Add OpenGraph images to case studies and other pages missing them

3. **Title and Description Consistency**
   - Ensure consistent formatting across similar page types
   - Standardize title patterns (e.g., "Product Name | Category | UNEOM Saudi Arabia")

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Run `npm run check:seo` regularly to monitor SEO health
- Before each deployment, run `npm run fix:seo` to catch and fix issues
- Address high-priority issues (missing metadata, duplicates) first
- Periodically review robots.txt in Google Search Console to ensure resources are accessible

## Build Performance Improvements

These SEO fixes not only improve search engine visibility but also resolve build errors that were occurring due to:

1. Mixed client/server component issues (using both `'use client'` and metadata in the same file)
2. Inconsistent metadata structures
3. Large metadata objects in client components
4. Missing or conflicting metadata exports

By implementing these fixes, the build process is now more reliable and consistent.
