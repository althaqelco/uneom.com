              <h2>Professional-Grade Welding Protection for Saudi Arabian Industries</h2>
              <p>
                UNEOM's premium leather welding aprons are engineered specifically for the demanding welding environments found throughout Saudi Arabia's industrial sectors. Our heavy-duty welding protection is trusted by professionals in oil and gas, manufacturing, construction, and fabrication workshops across Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam, and industrial cities throughout the Kingdom.
              </p>
              
              <h3>Superior Heat and Spark Protection</h3>
              <p>
                Each UNEOM welding apron is crafted from premium split cowhide leather with a thickness of 1.2-1.4mm, providing exceptional resistance to sparks, spatter, and heat up to 200Â°C. The flame-resistant properties ensure protection during intense welding operations, while the reinforced stitching with Kevlar thread enhances durability in high-stress areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our aprons feature a specialized treatment that maintains flexibility even after prolonged exposure to heat, preventing the cracking and stiffening common in lower-quality welding gear. This ensures comfort during long shifts while maintaining essential protection against molten metal splashes and UV radiation from welding arcs.
              </p>
              
              <h3>Engineered for Saudi Arabian Welding Environments</h3>
