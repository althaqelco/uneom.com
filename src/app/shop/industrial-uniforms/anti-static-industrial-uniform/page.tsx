              <h2>Superior ESD Protection Engineered for Saudi Arabia's Specialized Industries</h2>
              <p>
                UNEOM's Premium Anti-Static Industrial Uniforms represent the pinnacle of electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection technology specifically engineered for Saudi Arabia's most sensitive industrial environments. Developed through extensive research and testing in actual Saudi industrial conditions, these specialized garments provide reliable protection against potentially catastrophic static electricity risks while maintaining exceptional comfort in the Kingdom's demanding climate.
              </p>
              
              <h3>Advanced Anti-Static Technology</h3>
              <p>
                Our Premium Anti-Static Industrial Uniforms incorporate multiple complementary technologies that work together to provide comprehensive ESD protection:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Carbon-Core Thread Technology:</strong> Proprietary carbon-infused fibers woven throughout the fabric create a continuous conductive network that safely dissipates static charge</li>
                <li><strong>Static Dissipative Fabric Blend:</strong> Special polyester-cotton blend with permanent anti-static properties that maintain effectiveness even after hundreds of industrial wash cycles</li>
                <li><strong>Conductive Grid Design:</strong> Strategic placement of highly conductive threads in a grid pattern ensures consistent charge dissipation across the entire garment</li>
                <li><strong>Surface Resistivity Control:</strong> Carefully engineered to maintain optimal surface resistivity (10⁶ to 10⁹ ohms) for effective static dissipation without compromising wearer safety</li>
                <li><strong>Triboelectric Neutralization:</strong> Fabric treatment that minimizes charge generation from friction during movement, crucial in dry Saudi environments known for high static generation</li>
                <li><strong>Metal-Free Design:</strong> Uses specialized non-metallic conductive closures and accessories to maintain ESD protection while eliminating spark risks</li>
                <li><strong>Humidity-Independent Performance:</strong> Maintains consistent anti-static properties regardless of ambient humidity, essential in Saudi Arabia's varied climate conditions</li>
                <li><strong>Groundable Connection Points:</strong> Strategic conductive points integrated for connection to grounding systems when required in ultra-sensitive environments</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Quality Assurance and Testing</h3>
              <p>
                Every batch of our Premium Anti-Static Industrial Uniforms undergoes rigorous quality control testing:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Surface resistivity measurements at multiple points across each garment</li>
                <li>Static decay rate testing under controlled humidity conditions simulating Saudi environments</li>
                <li>Triboelectric charge generation testing to verify minimal static build-up during normal movement</li>
                <li>Continuity testing to ensure consistent conductivity throughout the garment</li>
                <li>Accelerated wash testing to verify maintained performance after multiple industrial laundering cycles</li>
                <li>High-temperature performance verification simulating peak Saudi summer conditions</li>
