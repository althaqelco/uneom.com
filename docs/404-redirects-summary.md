## Implementation Details

All redirects have been implemented in `next.config.js` using Next.js's redirect configuration with `permanent: true` (301 status code). This ensures:

1. **SEO Value Preservation**: Search engines will transfer any existing page authority to the destination pages
2. **User Experience**: Visitors are automatically redirected to relevant content
3. **Clean URL Structure**: No broken links or 404 errors for these URLs

## Note on Image URL

The URL `/ar/images/products/industrial-coverall.jpg` appears to be an image file path, not a page URL. This should be handled by ensuring the image exists in the correct location: `/public/images/products/industrial-coverall.jpg`
