# 404 Status Code Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to properly implement 404 pages on the Uneom website, ensuring that search engines receive the appropriate HTTP response code (404) when visiting a non-existent page.

## The Problem Solved
The website was suffering from a serious SEO issue where all non-existent pages were displaying **404 content** but with a **HTTP 200 status code** (which is a "success" code).

This led to:
- Search engines indexing non-existent pages (reducing site quality in Google's view)
- Inaccurate analytics data (recording successful visits to non-existent pages)
- Inconsistent user experience (browser indicates success while user sees an error page)

## The Solution Implemented

### 1. Netlify Configuration
The `netlify.toml` file was updated to address this issue:

```toml
# Fallback for non-found routes - Modified to return proper 404 code
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/404.html"
  status = 404
  force = false
  conditions = {path = {match = "^(?!(api|_next|images|assets|css|js|fonts|favicon)/)"}}
```

This ensures:
- All non-existent paths are redirected to `/404.html`
- A correct HTTP 404 status code is sent
- Paths for assets, APIs, and Next.js system resources are excluded from this rule

### 2. Static 404.html File
A `public/404.html` file was created to serve as a fallback error page. It contains:
- The meta tag `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">`
- Design consistent with brand identity
- Links to both Arabic and English versions
- Appropriate 404 page content

### 3. Not Found Component
The `src/app/not-found.tsx` component was enhanced by adding:
- Appropriate metadata for SEO optimization
- Proper `robots` settings
- Improved design with links to both Arabic and English versions

```tsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "404 - Page Not Found | Uneom",
  description: "Sorry, the page you are looking for does not exist.",
  robots: {
    index: false,
    follow: false,
  },
};
```

### 4. Robots.txt Optimization
The `robots.txt` file was updated to add additional directives for search engines:

```
# Exclude error pages
Disallow: /404.html
Disallow: /*?*
```

## How to Verify the Implementation

1. **Using the custom verification script**:
   ```
   node check-404-seo.js
   ```
   This script performs a comprehensive evaluation of 404 pages and calculates an SEO score based on several factors.

2. **Manually using web tools**:
   - Use browser developer tools (F12) to inspect the HTTP response
   - Try visiting a non-existent URL like: `https://uneom.com/non-existent-page`
   - You should see a 404 response code in the Network tab

3. **Using external tools**:
   - [httpstatus.io](https://httpstatus.io/) - Check HTTP status code
   - [Screaming Frog](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/) - Comprehensive SEO checking tool

## Best Practices Followed

1. **Appropriate meta tags**:
   - Title including "404" and "Page Not Found"
   - Appropriate description explaining that the page doesn't exist
   - `noindex` tag to prevent indexing

2. **Appropriate content**:
   - Clear message explaining the problem
   - Visible 404 code
   - Useful links for the user (return to homepage, language toggle)

3. **Correct HTTP status code**:
   - 404 response, not 200
   - Ensure it works with all non-existent paths

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### How to know if the problem still exists:
1. Run the `check-404-seo.js` script
2. Look in Google Search Console for indexed 404 pages
3. Check server logs to verify status codes

### If the problem persists:
1. Check Netlify settings in the control panel
2. Make sure the `netlify.toml` file was published correctly
3. Update configuration file settings based on [official Netlify documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/redirect-options/)
4. Use Netlify Dev locally to test settings before deployment

## Benefits of Proper Implementation

1. **SEO Improvement**:
   - Prevent search engines from indexing non-existent pages
   - Improve site quality score in Google's view

2. **More Accurate Analytics**:
   - Correct recording of successful versus failed visits
   - Better knowledge of broken links on the site

3. **Consistent User Experience**:
   - Clear expectations for users about page status
   - Provide useful alternatives when encountering a non-existent page

**Note**: This check should be run after each major deployment to ensure that 404 settings continue to work correctly.
