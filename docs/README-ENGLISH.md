# 404 Error Page Implementation Improvement for Uneom

## üìã Project Overview

Several improvements have been made to address the 404 page issue on the Uneom website. The main problem was that non-existent pages were displaying 404 error content but with an HTTP 200 status code (success), negatively impacting SEO and user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Changes

### 1. Server Configuration
- Updated `netlify.toml` to send the correct 404 status code for non-existent pages
- Excluded static assets and system files from the redirect rule

### 2. Error Page Improvements
- Created a `public/404.html` file as a fallback error page
- Enhanced the `src/app/not-found.tsx` component with appropriate metadata
- Included `noindex` tags to prevent indexing of error pages

### 3. SEO Optimization
- Updated `robots.txt` to exclude 404 pages from indexing
- Added appropriate titles and descriptions for error pages
- Ensured all error pages display useful messages to users

### 4. Verification Tools
- Script `check-404-seo.js` to evaluate 404 implementation and calculate an SEO score
- Script `verify-production-404.js` to verify implementation in the production environment after deployment

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Verify Changes

### After Deployment
1. Run the production verification script:
```bash
node verify-production-404.js
```

2. Run the comprehensive SEO assessment:
```bash
node check-404-seo.js
```

3. Manually verify non-existent URLs:
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Visit a non-existent page (e.g., `https://uneom.com/this-page-does-not-exist`)
- Check for HTTP 404 response code in the Network tab

## üîç Recommended Next Steps

1. **Monitor Google Search Console** to ensure 404 pages are no longer indexed
2. **Set up alerts** for any unexpected increase in 404 errors
3. **Improve user experience** on 404 pages to reduce bounce rate
4. **Periodically review** to ensure the configuration continues to work correctly
